## Biased opinion

> Go is simply amazing! Think Python simplicity with C++ performance and zero Java BS and no JavaScript esotericism. Testing, documentation and package management ships with the language. Also compiles to binary. What more can you possibly want? Composition over Inheritance every time baby! I love it! Let's Go!
